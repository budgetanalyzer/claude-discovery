            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Discover architects who've independently adopted discovery patterns for AI-native development.
                This isn't about evangelism or user acquisition - it's about finding peers who independently
                arrived at similar insights about building software with AI as a collaborative partner.

            <h3>The Problem We're Solving</h3>
            <p>
                You can't get people to run setup scripts. You can't evangelize architectural patterns.
                But you <strong>can</strong> find people who've already figured it out independently.
                Discovery patterns in documentation are the beacon - a signal that someone is thinking
                about AI-native architecture at a similar level.

            <h3>What Is claude-discovery?</h3>
            <p>A tool to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Search GitHub</strong> for repositories using discovery patterns in documentation</li>
                <li><strong>Extract contact information</strong> from those repos</li>
                <li><strong>Analyze quality signals</strong> to distinguish production implementations from tutorials</li>
                <li><strong>Generate a registry</strong> of potential peers for conversation</li>
                <li><strong>Identify emergent patterns</strong> across different implementations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This is <strong>discovery</strong>, not indexing. We're looking for the
                "five people on the planet" working on this, not building a comprehensive catalog.

            <h3>Why Discovery Patterns Matter</h3>
            <p>
                We're looking for a specific architectural approach, not a filename convention:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discovery commands over static lists</strong> - repos that teach through exploration</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern recognition</strong> - if someone independently adopted discovery-based docs, they "get it"</li>
                <li><strong>Filename agnostic</strong> - whether it's README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, or CLAUDE.md doesn't matter</li>
                <li><strong>Signal of sophistication</strong> - using grep/kubectl/docker commands in docs shows production thinking</li>
            </ul>

                    <p>
                        We're not trying to convince people to adopt a convention. We're finding people
                        who already figured out the pattern independently.

                    <p>
                        Finding 5 peer architects is more valuable than cataloging 500 repos with
                        renamed READMEs. We're looking for production experience and independent insight.

                    <h4>3. Privacy-Respecting</h4>
                    <p>
                        Only index public information. Respect robots.txt. Provide opt-out mechanisms.
                        Don't scrape aggressively. Be a good citizen.

                        The code is public not for user acquisition but for discoverability.
                        Someone pointing their AI at this project should understand the pattern immediately.

                        This tool itself exemplifies the patterns we're looking for: discoverable,

                        This registry is public but respectful. Repositories can request inclusion or
                        exclusion at any time. Privacy and consent are paramount.

            <h3>The Hypothesis</h3>
            <blockquote>
                There are architects independently discovering that microservices align perfectly with AI context windows,
                pattern-based documentation beats static lists, and discovery commands in documentation enable AI-native development.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                If you found it, others will too. Discovery patterns in documentation are the beacon
                that makes them discoverable.
