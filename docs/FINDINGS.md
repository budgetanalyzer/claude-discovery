# Qualitative Findings

This document records qualitative observations and insights from discovered repositories.

**Status**: Not yet generated (Phase 2)

## Purpose

While PATTERNS.md catalogs structural patterns, this document captures:
- Surprising discoveries
- Unique approaches that don't fit patterns
- Evidence of independent innovation
- Quality of architectural thinking
- Potential peer candidates

## Categories

### High-Potential Peers
Repositories scored 7+ on peer potential, with notes on:
- What makes them stand out
- Evidence of production usage
- Architectural sophistication
- Contact approach strategy

### Independent Discovery Evidence
Signs that architects arrived at patterns independently:
- Unique terminology or naming
- Novel approaches to common problems
- Timestamps showing parallel development
- Different tech stacks with similar patterns

### Production vs Tutorial
Distinguishing factors between production implementations and tutorials:
- Depth of infrastructure code
- Monitoring and observability
- Secret management and security
- Database migrations and data management

### Architectural Insights
Interesting architectural decisions:
- Novel service boundaries
- Unique deployment strategies
- Creative documentation approaches
- Effective use of discovery patterns

### Negative Findings
What we learned from repos that scored low:
- Common anti-patterns
- Superficial adoption (renamed files without substance)
- Tutorial-only implementations
- Why they don't indicate peer potential

## Conversations

Notes from conversations with discovered peers:
- Initial contact approach
- Their perspective on discovery patterns
- What they discovered independently
- Ideas for collaboration or learning

## Hypothesis Validation

Testing our core hypothesis:
> "There are architects independently discovering that microservices, pattern-based documentation, and discovery commands enable AI-native development."

Evidence for/against:
- How many repos found?
- Quality of implementations?
- Evidence of independent discovery?
- Validation of pattern effectiveness?
