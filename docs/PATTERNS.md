# Observed Architectural Patterns

This document catalogs architectural patterns observed in discovered repositories.

**Status**: Not yet generated (Phase 2)

Once we run the discovery tool and find repositories using discovery patterns, this document will be auto-generated with observations about:

## Pattern Categories

### Discovery Documentation Patterns
- How are discovery commands structured?
- What commands are most common?
- Are there emerging conventions?

### Microservices Topology
- How many repos per project?
- How are they organized?
- What naming conventions?

### Tech Stack Clustering
- What technology combinations are common?
- Spring Boot + React? Django + Vue? Go microservices?
- Infrastructure patterns (K8s, Docker, etc.)

### Repository Organization
- Monorepo vs repo-per-service
- Hybrid approaches
- Cross-repo documentation strategies

### Development Environment Patterns
- Containerized development (devcontainers)
- Local Kubernetes (Tilt, Kind, etc.)
- CI/CD integration

## Analysis

Patterns will be analyzed for:
- **Frequency** - How common is this pattern?
- **Quality correlation** - Do certain patterns correlate with high-quality scores?
- **Independence** - Evidence of independent discovery vs copying
- **Evolution** - How do patterns change over time?
